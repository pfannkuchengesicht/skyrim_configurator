# Skyrim Configurator

This is a simple Qt-based utility to edit the configuration files of the game "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim". It was started as a small project in 2011 with the intent to create a configuration utility that lets you easily change the settings 
of aforementioned game while also giving you some indication as to what it'll change. Thus reducing the guess work while editing the configuration files by hand.

This is an independent project and in no way affiliated with Bethesda Softworks, ZeniMax Media or any other party involved in the development of TESV.

## Building

To build this program, you'll need Qt 4.7 or higher and probably some compiler and maybe the Windows SDK. Really depends if you want to use MinGW or the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. It was tested with the latter, but it should work with the former as well.
